										If you’re a resident of Spain, you must pay Spanish tax on your worldwide income. Taxes apply on a progressive scale, although tax deductions exist. If you are a non-resident in
										Spain, you only pay tax in Spain on Spanish income, typically at a flat rate.
									</p>
									<p>Spanish tax also applies to property ownership, investment interest, and goods and services (VAT) in Spain. Here as some of them:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Income taxes</li>
										<li>Wealth taxes</li>
										<li>Inheritance taxes</li>
										<li>Property taxes</li>
									</ul>
									<p>You should know that taxes in Spain are split between state and regional governments.</p>
									<p>
										This means that Spanish tax rates can vary across the country for income tax, property tax, wealth tax, capital gains tax, and inheritance tax in Spain. Furthermore, workers in
										Spain must contribute to Spanish social security taxes.
										<strong>The Spanish tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December</strong>

								<div class="insert-modal-content">
									<p>So, basically, this special tax regime for expats make it possible to end up paying much lower taxes, hence being able to save huge amounts of money.</p>
									<p>It allows all the workers who reside abroad that want to come to work in Spain to pay income and wealth tax as if they were non-residents during the first 6 years.</p>

									<p>
										It was
										<strong>created to attract talent and qualified workers into Spain</strong>
										; and got its name after the famous football player David Beckham (the first one to take advantage of it).
									</p>
									<p>
										Under the Beckham law, no matter if you spend over 183 days in the country (hence becoming a tax resident), you will pay taxes under taxation rules similar tho those who are
										non-residents.
									</p>
									<p>
										Now expats can pay much less
										<strong>during their first 6 years in the country</strong>
										. And they can save taxes provided that they apply for this regime.
									</p>

									<p>
										As far as Wealth Tax is concerned, is
										<strong>a tax for high net worth residents in Spain</strong>
										.
									</p>
									<p>
										Spain continues to be a favourite destination for expatriates, including those making the most of their retirement years. There are many benefits to living here, and with the wide
										variety of property and locations, there is a dream home for everyone.
									</p>
									<p>
										Besides the expected income and capital gains taxes, Spain additionally imposes an annual wealth tax. While most people are exempt – in general, if you are resident in Spain, you
										can only be affected if
										<strong>the net value of your worldwide assets is over €1 million</strong>
										– it can have a significant impact on wealthy individuals.
